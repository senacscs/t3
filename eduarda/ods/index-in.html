            <h2> Author Analysis</h2>
            <p>SDG 3 (Health and Well-being) has as its main goal to bring physical and mental health, as well as a high quality lifestyle, to everyone, spanning all age groups. Some of the targets of SDG 3 include disease prevention and treatment, reduction of maternal and child mortality, combating epidemics, strengthening the responsiveness of healthcare systems, and promoting access to safe and effective medicines, while also fostering research and vaccine development.

                The Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA) provides various indicators that monitor the progress of this sustainable development goal in Brazil. The most notable ones include infant mortality rate, life expectancy at birth, and vaccination coverage. Overall, these indicators ensure access to necessary care for the survival of children, measure the quality of healthcare systems and lifestyles, and the proportion of immunized individuals. Thus, they provide data that contribute to health and well-being.
                
                The IBGE Census also provides contributing data, mainly of demographic nature. Through it, we can identify inequalities in relation to SDG 3. The Census can highlight disparities in access to healthcare services and other social determinants. Identifying these inequalities is as crucial as identifying progress, as from problems, we can derive solutions. </p>

            <h2>Interdisciplinary Activity</h2>
            <p>1-The importance is that in addition to connecting with nature, people who practice outdoor physical activities can have a social interaction with the people around them. The benefits for people who live close to open public spaces are that they have a lower prevalence of chronic diseases, as well as proximity to green areas can promote mental health for different age groups.<br><br>

                2-Factors that can make open public spaces more attractive are: the place in question being more accessible to people who have a disability or elderly people with reduced mobility and also contain security, especially for those who like to practice exercises at night.
In addition to becoming a more accessible and safer place, greener areas can encourage more people of different age groups.<br><br>

3-Promoting activities or even events that are interesting for friends and families of different age groups to be able to participate in, this would be another way of getting interested in the practice of physical activities. </p><br>
4-Physical activity can improve people's health, preventing diseases from having a part of the population that prefers to walk or cycle, reducing air pollution. Sport helps in teamwork, thus increasing the practice of socialization among people, thus building a more harmonious society. The biggest challenge today is to get some people out of their homes and sedentary lifestyle.
