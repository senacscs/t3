        <h1>What are SDGs:</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) are a global call to action to end or at least reduce poverty, protect the environment and climate, and ensure that people everywhere can enjoy peace and prosperity. These goals are implemented by countries and the UN itself through donations from institutions, governments, or individuals. The SDGs program takes actions worldwide, in addition to supporting small projects to achieve its goals before it's too late.</p>
        <h1>SDG 1</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;SDG 1: Eradication of poverty, meaning to eliminate it in all its forms and everywhere.
                
                To achieve this goal, the country will need to establish new policy frameworks to ensure that social protection systems reach poor and vulnerable individuals, especially given the issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
                
                Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, data indicated that 1.2 billion people in 111 developing countries live in poverty considered "acute multidimensional".
                
                This is almost twice the number of people classified as "poor", surviving on less than $1.90 per day.
                
                The study is visionary because it goes beyond income as a parameter of poverty to truly understand how people experience social vulnerability in all aspects. For example: access to education and healthcare; housing; clean water; sanitation; electricity; and so on.

        <h1>Targets:</h1>
            <p class="meta">&emsp;&emsp;Target 1.5: United Nations
                By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations, and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social, and environmental shocks and disasters.
                Brazil
                By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations, and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social, and environmental shocks and disasters.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Action 1: Technological investment, which can be through an app that notifies the cellphone owner about possible environmental events. The goal is to provide advance notice so that people can organize and seek safe shelter, minimizing the risks of major damage. The app comes pre-installed on all cellphones, and safety messages are sent to everyone when there are risks.<br>
                Action 2: Individuals responsible for environmental safety could collaborate with the government to identify high-risk areas and somehow arrange alternative locations for people to live in safety.<br>
                Action 3: Send messages to people via SMS who don't have access to the internet or high-quality technological cellphones.</p>
            <p class="meta">&emsp;&emsp;Target 1.4: United Nations
                By 2030, ensure that all men and women, particularly the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership, and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology, and financial services, including microfinance.
                Brazil
                By 2030, ensure that all men and women, particularly the poor and those in vulnerable situations, have access to social services, basic infrastructure, new technology, and means of production, information and communication technologies, financial services, and equitable access to land and natural resources.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Action 1: Facilitate greater internet and technology access for the most vulnerable people through a phone that's provided after requesting and accounting for its use (similar to the basic needs basket system). The cellphone would then be used to address prevailing issues.<br>
                Action 2: Make Wi-Fi and phones more accessible for low-income individuals. A person could prove their lower income and receive a considerable reduction in internet/phone costs.<br>
                Action 3: Establish a location in the city with computers and free Wi-Fi (government-funded) so that people without resources can have some opportunity for study, work, or even resolving payments without spending anything.</p>
