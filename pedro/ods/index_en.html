            <h2>Indicators and Census</h2>
            <p class="color-white">12.5
                By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse.
            </br>
            12.6
            Encourage companies, especially large and transnational companies, to adopt sustainable practices and integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle.      </br>
            The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) plays a key role in promoting and monitoring SDG 12 in Brazil. As the body responsible for producing and disseminating statistical, geographical and environmental information, the IBGE contributes to the advancement of indicators related to consumption and production.<br>
            With regard to waste management, the IBGE carries out the National Basic Sanitation Survey, which collects data on the collection, treatment and final disposal of solid waste in Brazil. This information is crucial for implementing strategies to reduce, recycle and properly treat waste in order to achieve the goals of SDG 12.<br>

                SDG 12, or Sustainable Development Goal 12, is part of the 2030 Agenda formulated by the United Nations to promote global sustainable development. SDG 12 aims to guarantee consumption and production patterns. This goal is key to tackling global challenges related to excessive consumption, waste generation and environmental degradation. Humans use natural resources unsustainably, leading to resource depletion, fuel and biodiversity loss. Sustainable Development Goal 12 aims to reverse this trend and promote consumption and production patterns towards more attractive practices. Achieving this goal requires more efficient use of resources and energy, eliminating waste and promoting recycling. In addition, awareness should be raised about the importance of responsible consumption and consumers should be informed about the most available options on the market.<br>
                
                SDG 12 also aims to encourage industry and companies to adopt more active practices in their operations. This involves promoting energy efficiency, the use of renewable raw materials, fuel reduction and the implementation of responsible environmental management practices.</p>

    <h1>Working with Physical Education</h1><br>
    <h4>1. How important are public open spaces in promoting physical activity and community health? Discuss how parks, squares, walking trails and other public outdoor areas can positively influence people's exercise habits. What are the physical and mental benefits associated with practicing physical activity in these spaces?  </h4>
    <p>These are important for people who don't have the financial need to exercise, or for people who haven't started any other exercise yet, it can be a great motivator. These kinds of public places, such as squares or pedestrian paths, have a great impact on physical activity, because when you're in a beautiful place or where there are more people and life, they motivate you. The physical and mental benefits are that the person has a healthier, stronger and more robust body, and of the mental benefits, physical activity contributes mainly to the recovery and production of dopamine in the brain.  </p><br>
    <h4>2. What are the design factors that make a public space attractive for physical activity? Explore aspects such as accessibility, safety, variety of sports facilities, green areas and social interaction. How can a well-designed space encourage different age groups and fitness levels to get involved in outdoor activities?  </h4><br>
    <p>In terms of design, it depends on the target audience we want, but for the majority of the public, the gym will have brighter colors to attract the attention of passers-by, for the blind, a sign in Braille to facilitate access and some descriptions. Braille, a ramp for wheelchair users, we're going to get help from the town hall to take care of the equipment for the ramps and boards so that nothing gets in the way of each user's physical activity.  </p><br>
    <h4>3. How can communities promote the use of public open spaces for physical activity? Discuss strategies that schools, local governments and community organizations can adopt to encourage people to take advantage of these spaces for exercise. This could involve awareness campaigns, group physical activity programs, sporting events or even the integration of exercise tracking technologies. </h4><br>
    <p>We could do this as a community event like "Saint Ignatius community", The Saint Ignatius community organizes an event where the whole community can invite a neighbor or acquaintance to come out. it's a context menu.</p><br>
