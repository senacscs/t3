                        <h3>SDG description</h3>
            
                            <p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 7, has as its main goal to promote access to reliable energy, clean and sustainable energy for the whole world by 2030. 
                            <br>
                            The SDG seeks to generate global access to modern energy services that are sustainable and affordable. The goal is to provide everyone with access to sustainable energy for efficient energy consumption in both commercial offices and homes. Furthermore, the use of sustainable energy in buildings and homes can be cheaper than energy from fossil fuels.
                            <br>
                            Renewable energy also has one more advantageous characteristic, that of not generating carbon emissions, making the impact on the planet less.. </p>

                        <h3>IPEA indicators:</h3>
            
                            <p>To ensure that SDG 7 makes progress, the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA) has created some indicators. The indicators are as follows:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Access to electricity: Inform the percentage of people who have electricity, in cities and in the countryside. It is important to see if every population has access to energy. </li>
                                <li>Use of renewable sources: Amount of sustainable energy generated, compared to the energy we use in total. </li>
                                <li>Energy efficiency: Intensity at which we generate/expend energy, we measure this according to GDP.  </li>
                                <li>Clean energy investment: Funds invested in clean and sustainable energy projects. The more investment we have, the new ideas and technologies will emerge. </li>
                            </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The Brazilian urbanization rate is 84.72% and the rural one is 15.28%. With these data, we can analyze, on average, what amount of sustainable energy generation will be necessary to meet the needs of this population.</li>

                            <li>National electricity consumption was 42,837 GWh in January 2023. The residential class (+1.8%) led the increase, followed by the commercial class (+1.4%) and industrial class (+1.2%). We can see that compared to last year, there was an increase, in January, of 4.4% in energy consumption in relation to all classes.</li>
                        
                            <li>Analyzing the image on the side, we see that the South, Southeast and Midwest regions are the ones with the highest purchasing power. So, we could organize ourselves to help these regions to have access to sustainable energy and help to identify inequality when it comes to achieving access to clean energy. </li>

                <h3>Goal 7.1</h3>

                <p>By 2030, ensure universal, reliable, modern and affordable access to energy services.</p>

                <h3>Solutions</h3>

                <ol>

                    <li>We could invest in structures that have renewable energy, such as wind farms and solar plants.</li>
                    <li>We thought about developing a website to allow greater access to this knowledge, in this case, sustainable energy technology.</li>
                    <li>We could propose partnerships with public-private companies to cover remote and rural areas that do not have access to this technology..</li>

            </div>

            <div>

                <h3>Goal 7.2</h3>

                <p>By 2030, substantially increase the share of renewable energies in the global energy mix.</p>

                <h3>Solutions</h3>

                <ol>

                    <li>We would try to put sustainable energy sources in transport vehicles, to further increase the production of that energy.</li>
                    <li>Invest in research related to energy storage and carbon capture in the atmosphere.</li>
                    <li>We could create an application, with universal translation, so that there is an exchange of experiences with other countries, thus encouraging and sharing knowledge.</li>
