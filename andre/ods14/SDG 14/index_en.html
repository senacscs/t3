            <h2>Indexes & Surveys</h2>
            <p class="color-white"> SDG 14 is based on conserving and sustainably utilizing the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. One of the indicators is "number of protected marine areas". This indicator measures the extent of ocean areas that have received some form of protection, such as marine reserves, marine national parks or coastal conservation areas. The protection of these areas is essential to ensure the preservation of marine ecosystems and biodiversity. The relationship with information from the IBGE Census could be observed in the survey of economic activity linked to the marine sector. The census can provide data on the number of people employed in activities such as fishing, aquaculture, coastal tourism and the shipbuilding industry. This information helps to understand the socioeconomic impact of actions related to SDG 14, allowing the development of more effective public policies for the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources. Target 14.1 Conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Indicators coastal water eutrophication index and floating plastic debris density index. Target 14.2 By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including through strengthening their resilience, and take steps towards their restoration, in order to ensure healthy and productive oceans. Indicators Proportion of national Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) managed based on the use of ecosystem approaches. </p>

        <p>Goal 14.5 By 2020, conserve at least 25% of coastal and marine areas, mainly areas of special importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, ensuring and respecting the demarcation, regularization and effective and equitable management, aiming to guarantee the interconnection, integration and ecological representation in broader seascapes, in accordance with national and international legislation, and based on the best available scientific information.</p><br>
        <p>Actions: Carry out awareness campaigns so that people preserve coastal and marine areas, stopping illegal fishing, and pollution in rivers, lakes and dams, putting up illegal fishing warning signs, and if they continue fishing illegally, it can be applied a fine of up to R$1,800.</p>

        <h2>Physical Education Activity with PP</h2>
        <p>1. How important are public open spaces in promoting physical activity and community health? Discuss how parks, plazas, walking trails and other outdoor public areas can positively influence people's exercise habits. What are the physical and mental benefits associated with the practice of physical activities in these spaces?</p>
        <p>A: Public open spaces play a key role in promoting physical activity and improving community health. They provide an accessible and inviting environment for people to engage in a variety of physical activities, such as walking, jogging, cycling, stretching and even group sports. The existence of parks, plazas, walking trails and other outdoor public areas has a significant impact on people's exercise habits and offers a range of physical and mental benefits.</p>
        <p>2. What are the design factors that make a public space attractive for physical activity? Explore aspects such as accessibility, safety, variety of sports facilities, green areas and social interaction. How can a well-designed space offer different age groups and fitness levels to engage in outdoor activities?</p>
        <p>A: A well-designed public space for physical activity takes into account a number of factors that make the environment attractive and inviting for different age groups and fitness levels. Here are some key design aspects that can encourage active participation.</p>
        <p>3. How can communities promote the use of open public spaces for physical activity? Discuss strategies that schools, local governments, and community organizations can adopt to encourage people to take advantage of these exercise spaces.</p>
        <p>A: This could involve awareness campaigns, group fitness programs, sporting events or even the integration of exercise tracking technologies. Promoting the use of open public spaces for physical activity involves a combination of coordinated efforts between schools, local governments, community organizations and even the active participation of citizens themselves.</p>
        <p>4. Considering the interrelation between Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 ("Health and Wellbeing") and 11 ("Sustainable Cities and Communities"), how can the promotion of physical activity in open public spaces contribute to building of cities that meet these objectives in an integrated way? Discuss how incorporating active habits into everyday routines can not only improve individual quality of life, but also positively impact the urban environment, mobility, sense of community and the quality of public space. What are the challenges and opportunities of reconciling SDGs 3 and 11 to the benefit of both people and the environment?</p>
        <p>A: Promoting physical activity in open public spaces can play a crucial role in mainstreaming Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 ("Health and Wellbeing") and 11 ("Sustainable Cities and Communities"). By incorporating active habits into daily routines, cities can create a virtuous cycle that benefits both people and the environment.</p>
