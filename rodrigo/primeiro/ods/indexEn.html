        <h1>WHat are the DSGs:</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The DSG (develops sustein goal) are a global a  call for help about action for endend or to decrease the poverty, protect the enviromenta and the climate and guarantee the people , in the all of places, can enjoy the peace and prosperyt. The develops are performed by the countries and the ONU by means of insuctions, goverts  and fisical peoples. The ODS program action arround the word and support small projects to achieve yours obrjetives.</p>
        <h1>O que é a ODS 6?</h1> 
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;SDG 6 aims to provide safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030, while also ensuring the quality of water delivery and the preservation of water bodies. It also seeks to increase access to basic sanitation, thereby eliminating improper waste disposal.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Brazil shares the same deadline and objective, placing greater emphasis on improving the quality of water in water bodies to reduce water pollution. It also aims to increase the number of municipalities with access to sewage services, which was at 62.8% in 2017 according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).</p>

        <h1>Goals:</h1>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;The United Nations has several targets for each SDG, where each country can make adjustments. Here are two examples of goals and actions that we can take to achieve them:</p>
            <p class="meta">&emsp;&emsp;Goal 6.2: By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;This goal calls for various solutions, including easier access to sewage treatment and raising awareness about the consequences of improper waste disposal. For women and girls, it is necessary to distribute sanitary pads in public places and healthcare facilities to address menstrual poverty, in addition to maintaining the cleanliness of public restrooms. People in vulnerable situations should be educated about personal hygiene and waste disposal, with special attention to region-specific issues.</p>
            <p class="meta">&emsp;&emsp;Goal 6.3: By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating discharges, and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;To achieve this objective, numerous actions are required from both public and private entities, such as increasing oversight of industries that illegally discharge waste into water bodies, many of which go unpunished due to economic interests. We need to improve the stormwater drainage systems in cities to prevent them from carrying street litter into rivers or seas. Another crucial action is for everyone to refrain from littering, as rain can wash debris into water bodies.</p>

        <h1>Park Activity</h1>
        <h2>Orientations:</h2>
        <p>In the groups of the 'SDG Webpage' activity within the Professional Project curriculum, students need to engage in a careful and immersive reading of the article "How can open public spaces contribute to the promotion of physical activity?" attached herewith. Subsequently, in groups, reflect on the 'Oriented Run' field trip and the open public spaces you are familiar with in Santa Cruz do Sul.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p class="question">What is the importance of open public spaces in promoting physical activity and community health? Discuss how parks, squares, walking paths, and other outdoor public areas can positively influence people's exercise habits. What are the physical and mental benefits associated with engaging in physical activities in these spaces?</p>
                <p class="awnsor">These spaces are crucial for promoting community health by encouraging sports activities that can be done outdoors at no additional cost, allowing a broader range of users. Their use also contributes to the mental well-being of the population since they are often located near beaches or parks. Additionally, cities benefit from reduced healthcare costs as these environments help maintain the health of users.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p class="question">What are the design factors that make a public space attractive for physical activity? Explore aspects such as accessibility, safety, a variety of sports facilities, green areas, and social interaction. How can a well-designed space encourage individuals of different age groups and fitness levels to engage in outdoor activities?</p>
                <p class="awnsor">Several factors make a public space attractive for physical activity, including the condition of equipment and the environment, location, lighting, among others. A well-designed space encourages people of different age groups because it is more practical, avoids making a mess or clutter in the home environment, and provides an opportunity to get out of the house.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="question">How can communities promote the use of open public spaces for physical activity? Discuss strategies that schools, local governments, and community organizations can adopt to encourage people to make use of these spaces for exercise. This could involve awareness campaigns, group physical activity programs, sports events, or even the integration of exercise tracking technologies.</p>
                <p class="awnsor">Some strategies that schools can adopt to encourage people to utilize these spaces include: Awareness campaigns: conducting awareness campaigns in schools and communities to highlight the benefits of outdoor physical activity. This can include posters, educational lectures, and social media. Sports events: organizing soccer tournaments, races, picnics, and recreational competitions. Partnerships with schools: schools can integrate outdoor physical activities and expand sports facilities to maximize physical education classes, providing students with more space for activities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="question">Considering the interplay between Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3 ("Good Health and Well-being") and 11 ("Sustainable Cities and Communities"), how can the promotion of physical activity in open public spaces contribute to building cities that address these goals in an integrated manner? Discuss.</p>
                <p class="awnsor">The practicality of public spaces is an attraction for promoting community health and well-being, as it encourages bicycle use and walking, reducing environmental pollution. It also creates a city's identity, motivating the local population to engage in physical activities. One of the challenges in reconciling these SDGs is the lack of space for physical activity and motivating the population. An opportunity would be stress reduction, cycling and walking infrastructure, and exercise accessibility, all of which benefit people's health.</p>
