      <p class="analise">SDG 9 seeks to develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and cross-border infrastructure 
        (cities stretching from one side of the border to the other), to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on equitable access 
        and affordable so that everyone can afford to buy what they want, even if they are low-class.</p>

      <p>1. What is the importance of public open spaces in promoting physical activity and community health? Discuss how parks, squares, walking trails and other public outdoor areas can positively influence people's exercise habits.  What are the physical and mental benefits associated with practicing physical activity in these spaces?</p>
      <p>Public spaces play a very strong role in physical activity and health. Open spaces provide an environment for people to engage in exercise. In addition, they provide many physical and mental benefits, for example, socialization is a very good benefit for mental health.</p><br><br>
      <p>2. What are the design factors that make a public space attractive for physical activity?   Explore aspects such as accessibility, safety, variety of sports facilities, green areas and social interaction. How can a well-designed space encourage different age groups and fitness levels to get involved in outdoor activities?</p>
      <p>Accessibility is very important, such as ramps, tactile flooring, etc. Accessibility ensures that everyone can exercise physically and mentally. Safety ensures that people don't get hurt, and this includes the maintenance of the environment. The variety of equipment ensures that the environment doesn't get boring and repetitive. A lake with beautiful trees makes for a calm and peaceful place. Benches, signposts and events should not be missing in a public environment.</p><br><br>
      <p>3. How can communities promote the use of public open spaces for physical activity?  Discuss strategies that schools, local governments and community organizations can adopt to encourage people to take advantage of these spaces for exercise.  This could involve awareness campaigns, group physical activity programs, sporting events or even the integration of exercise tracking technologies.</p>
      <p>Promoting the use of open public spaces for physical activity requires a joint effort between schools, local governments and community organizations. Awareness campaigns, group physical activity programs, sporting events and the creation of adequate infrastructure in public spaces are some of the strategies that can be adopted to encourage people to take advantage of these spaces for exercise.</p><br><br>
      <p>4.Considering the interrelationship between Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 ("Health and Well-being") and 11 ("Sustainable Cities and Communities"), how can the promotion of physical activity in open public spaces contribute to building cities that meet these goals in an integrated way?  Discuss how incorporating active habits into daily routines can not only improve individual quality of life, but also have a positive impact on the urban environment, mobility, the sense of community and the quality of public space. What are the challenges and opportunities of reconciling SDGs 3 and 11 for the benefit of both people and the environment?</p>
      <p>Physical activity in open public spaces plays a key role in building cities that meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3, 11 in an integrated way. Active habits in daily routines can have a positive impact on both people's well-being and the urban environment.</p>
      <p>5. Monitoring and Evaluation: By reconciling Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 11, cities can be transformed into healthier, more vibrant and sustainable environments, where people's quality of life is improved, the community is strengthened and the urban environment is protected. This requires an integrated approach that prioritizes both human well-being and the environment.</p>
