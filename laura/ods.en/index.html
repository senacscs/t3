<li>1. Public environments such as parks, squares and walking paths are intended to encourage people to exercise regularly to maintain health and well-being, these places are also fundamental for the mental health of some people by creating friendships and meeting new people so they don't feel alone, being able to gather members of the community to practice sports and exercise together.
</li>
<li>2. Some factors that make a public space attractive is protection for older people and even for the visually impaired, having ramps and adequate sidewalks, security is also something that makes an attractive space such as lighting for people who only have shifts at night they can also practice exercises and attend these environments, they can also maintain a variety of sports, which may include basketball and soccer or volleyball courts. The green area is something essential for families to be able to use the environments more comfortably, being able to take their pets along, so it is important to have fixed benches and picnic tables.
</li>
<li>3. Schools, local governments and community organizations can organize weekly programs that contain the benefits of outdoor physical activities by creating groups in which they can practice running, walking, stretching, among others, which is carried out in squares and public parks. It would be very interesting because in addition to encouraging people to develop physical activities that are important for health, it would also create a sense of social community just by exercising outdoors.
</li>
<li>4.The integration of SDGs 3 and 11 can create public spaces and environments with the intention of encouraging the practice of exercises and even social interactions. It could also generate a strengthening between neighborhoods and communities as it would encourage people to leave the house and interact with neighbors, which could lead to social support and sometimes lessen the loneliness of some people.
