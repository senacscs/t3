                    The SDGs are part of the 2030 Agenda, signed in 2015 by 193 world leaders. It consists of an ambitious action plan that seeks to eradicate extreme poverty, combat inequality and injustice and contain climate change, among other actions.

                SDG 2 plays a crucial role in finding solutions to one of humanity's most pressing challenges: eradicating hunger and promoting sustainable agricultural systems. This goal aims to ensure universal access to adequate food, improve agricultural productivity, promote sustainable agriculture and support rural livelihoods. SDG 2 recognizes that hunger and malnutrition have a negative impact on a country's economic and social development, in addition to representing a violation of human rights. Achieving this goal requires coordinated action among governments, international organizations, the private sector, civil society to strengthen food systems, ensure access to nutritious food and promote sustainable agricultural practices.<br>
                Brazil is a country that could be greatly affected by this SDG. According to the 2022 IBGE census, the states in the northern region of the country have the highest average number of people per household (3.3). 25.7% of the entire population in the region experiences hunger. These data show the urgency of implementing effective actions and public policies aimed at SDG 2 in Brazil, aiming to combat hunger and promote sustainable agriculture, especially in the northern regions of the country.

            <button class="expand" onclick="handleExpand('1')">How important are public open spaces in promoting physical activity and community health? <img class="icon" src="../../assets/seta.png"></button>
            <p class="expandable hidden" id="1">Open public spaces are very important to encourage people to exercise and stay healthy. Parks, squares and walking trails are nice places where people can do physical activities, such as walking, running and cycling. These places are part of the daily life of the population, even if they do not interfere directly, they can end up encouraging the practice of physical activities. Performing exercises in open environments, such as squares and parks, with exuberant nature, are extremely beneficial for the individual's mental health.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="expandable-container">
            <button class="expand" onclick="handleExpand('2')">What are the design factors that make a public space attractive for physical activity? <img class="icon" src="../../assets/seta.png"></button>
            <p class="expandable hidden" id="2">
                An attractive public space for physical activity needs to be easy to reach, safe and inviting. Having varied sports facilities, such as courts and running tracks, variety is important to please everyone. Well-kept green areas and places to rest are also essential, social interaction is encouraged by benches and living spaces. Clear signage and accessibility for people with disabilities ensure inclusion. Sporting events and group classes bring excitement. Regular maintenance keeps the space enjoyable and a beautiful, functional design ensures it appeals to people of all ages promoting health and connection in the community.

        <div class="expandable-container">
            <button class="expand" onclick="handleExpand('3')">How can communities promote the use of open public spaces for physical activity? <img class="icon" src="../../assets/seta.png"></button>
            <p class="expandable hidden" id="3">
                To get people to use public spaces more to exercise, schools can teach about the benefits of exercise, local governments can organize classes and sporting events, and community organizations can use technology such as exercise apps. Another measure that can be taken is the maintenance of outdoor weight machines. They are often added to the environment and never maintained. This keeps away possible people who would use the environment. A good incentive for physical sports would be campaigns showing the result of a well-developed training routine. </p>    </div>
        <div class="expandable-container">
            <button class="expand" onclick="handleExpand('4')">Considering the interrelation between SDGs 3 and 11, how can the promotion of physical activity in public open spaces contribute to the construction of cities that meet these objectives in an integrated way? <img class="icon" src="../assets/seta.png"></button>
            <p class="expandable hidden" id="4">
                Promoting physical activity in public spaces contributes to building sustainable cities by linking the Sustainable Development Goals. This not only improves individual health, but also strengthens the community and the quality of public spaces. Encouraging active habits in everyday life not only benefits people, but also creates healthier urban environments, increases sustainable mobility, builds social ties and enriches the quality of spaces. However, there are challenges in balancing these goals, such as the lack of safe exercise areas and the promotion of accessibility for all. Still, the opportunity to create cities where health and well-being connect with better communities and public spaces is a pathway to the success of SDGs 3 and 11.</p>
